I am Tai-Quan "Winson" Peng, a Professor in the [Department of Communication](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng), Michigan State University. 

I am currently Editor-in-Chief for *[Human Communication Research](https://academic.oup.com/hcr)* (2025-) and was an Associate Editor for the *[Journal of Communication](https://academic.oup.com/joc)* (2022 - 2024). I was the guest co-editor of special issues at *Communication Methods and Measures* (van Atteveldt & Peng, 2018), *Asian Journal of Communication* (Peng, Liang, and Zhu, 2019), and *Journal of Communication* (Peng & Wang, ongoing). 

My research interest includes computational social science, health communication, audience analysis, and political communication. I am particularly interested in unraveling the structure & dynamics of human communication phenomena with various computational methods (e.g., network modeling, text mining, temporal and sequential modeling).
